This HTTP/REST-based server is built to be a platform for trading and battling with and against each other in a magical card-game world.   
• a user is a registered player with credentials (unique username, password).   
• a user can manage his cards.   
• a card consists of: a name and multiple attributes (damage, element type).   
• a card is either a spell card or a monster card.   
• the damage of a card is constant and does not change.   
• a user has multiple cards in his stack.   
• a stack is the collection of all his current cards (hint: cards can be removed by trading).   
• a user can buy cards by acquiring packages.   
• a package consists of 5 cards and can be acquired from the server by paying 5 virtual coins.    
• every user has 20 coins to buy (4) packages.    
• the best 4 cards are selected by the user to be used in the deck.    
• the deck is used in the battles against other players.     
• a battle is a request to the server to compete against another user with your currently defined deck (see detail description below).
